This is repository for my solutions for Advent of Code 2020 programming puzzles (https://adventofcode.com/2020/about).

Puzzle solutions are implemented with TypeScript/NodeJs (v12.7.0). If ts-node is installed globally, they can be run with `ts-node dayX.ts`, where X is in range [1,7]. Alternatively ts-node can be installed locally with npm install and used with `npx ts-node dayX.ts`.

Only the first 7 days have been solved for this year.
